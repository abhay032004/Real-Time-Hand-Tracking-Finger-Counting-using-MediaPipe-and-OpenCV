# Real-Time-Hand-Tracking-Finger-Counting-using-MediaPipe-and-OpenCV
A real-time computer vision system using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to detect hands and count raised fingers via webcam. Supports both hands, thumb detection based on orientation, and saves output video with visual overlays.

## 🎯 Project Vision

The goal of this project is to explore and demonstrate the power of real-time gesture recognition using AI and computer vision. It opens the door to a range of future applications including:

- Gesture-based user interfaces  
- Sign language recognition  
- Game control via hand movements  
- Contactless human-computer interaction systems  
- Smart home automation triggers using hand gestures  


## 🌟 Key Features

- ✋ **Real-time hand detection** using MediaPipe Hands  
- 🧠 **Intelligent thumb detection** based on left/right hand orientation  
- 🧮 **Accurate finger counting** including all five fingers  
- 🎥 **Live webcam feed** processing using OpenCV  
- 💾 **Video output recording** in `.mp4` format with visual overlays  
- 🔄 **Support for both hands** (multi-hand tracking up to 2 hands)  
- 🛠️ **Easily extendable** for gesture-controlled applications  

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Add gesture recognition for custom controls  
- Integrate with smart devices or games  
- Add GUI interface using Tkinter or PyQt  
- Upload output video directly to cloud or social media
