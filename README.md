# Real-Time-Hand-Tracking-Finger-Counting-using-MediaPipe-and-OpenCV
A real-time computer vision system using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to detect hands and count raised fingers via webcam. Supports both hands, thumb detection based on orientation, and saves output video with visual overlays.

## 🎯 Project Vision

The goal of this project is to explore and demonstrate the power of real-time gesture recognition using AI and computer vision. It opens the door to a range of future applications including:

- Gesture-based user interfaces  
- Sign language recognition  
- Game control via hand movements  
- Contactless human-computer interaction systems  
- Smart home automation triggers using hand gestures
